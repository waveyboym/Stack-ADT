1. open a terminal in the directory where the file is located, so if you wanted to test run the c++ version, you would open a terminal in a directory like so: "parent_directory/child_directory/c++"
2. type in the command make to compile the files
3. type in the command make run to run the files
4. type in make clean to clear out compilation files after running

#commands

1. make - compiles files
2. make run - runs the compiled files
3. make clean - cleans out the compiled files
4. make vangaurd - checks for memory leaks and reports if any are found

To make changes to the data and functions being run, open the "main.cpp", then you'll be able to change the input string and which functions are being run.
*You can only compile and run this in a linux environment
